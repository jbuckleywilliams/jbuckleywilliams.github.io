  <h2>Geographic Patterns</h2>
  <p>
    Texas, California, Florida, New York, and Illinois consistently experience the highest 
    concentrations of severe injuries, driven by industrial composition, population, and 
    seasonal labor patterns.
  </p>

  <h2>Temporal Trends</h2>
  <p>
    Summer months (May–August) exhibit predictable spikes due to increased construction 
    and outdoor labor. The COVID-19 period (2020) shows a notable dip and rebound.
  </p>

  <h2>Predictive Implications</h2>
  <p>
    The Negative Binomial model successfully anticipates future incident patterns. Employers 
    can use risk scores to schedule interventions, and regulators can prioritize inspections 
    based on forecasted risk levels.
  </p>

  <h2>Operational Guidance</h2>
  <p>
    Scores above 70 for two consecutive months prompt inspector deployment; scores above 
    50 trigger employer safety plan updates; insurers may apply surcharges or safety program 
    requirements for scores above 50.
