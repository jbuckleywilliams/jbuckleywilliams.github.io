  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This website summarizes a large-scale research study analyzing OSHA severe injury reports 
    from January 2015 through December 2022. Using Tableau and R Studio, the research 
    combines descriptive analytics, predictive modeling, and a comprehensive 0–100 risk score 
    framework to forecast severe injury risks for 2023–2025.
  </p>

  <p>
    The study identifies geographic and temporal injury patterns, constructs Negative Binomial 
    regression models, and creates a forward-looking risk score capable of guiding regulators, 
    employers, and insurance providers in proactive safety decision-making.
  </p>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>
    OSHA’s severe injury dataset offers a rich but underutilized source of safety intelligence. 
    By transforming raw historical incidents into predictive insights and interpretable risk scores, 
    organizations can move from reactive responses to proactive prevention. This website 
    presents those findings in an accessible and interactive format.
